# Maze generation Algorithm with Kruskal Algorithm 

Few months after finishing my first maze generation algorithm using a recursive backtracking algorithm ; I wanted to challenge myself with a better way to generate mazes : Kruskal Algorithm.
It took me around a week working on and off on it. I faced the same difficulties I had with the recursive backtracking algorithm : Data structures. It is SO hard to find the right one.
It took me several tries before finding the one that works for me. 

I already started optimisations tests: as of right now, March 1st 2022, I can generate a 100 x 100 matrix in 11.1s (average made with **111** rounds of tests (yes i find it very funny that I have an average of 11.1s with 111 rounds)).

v1.1 coming soon I hope !
